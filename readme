# Check Yo'Self
## By Ebenezer Jay Ingalsbe

### Intro
This application allows a user to create todo lists. The user must enter a title
and a task into the input fields. The user must then click the add icon (inside the item input).
After a task and a title have been added, the user may then click on the "Make Task List" button
to add the card to the page. When the card is added to the dom, it also is saved in local storage.

### Learning Goals
1. Solidify and demonstrate your use of:
    a. semantic HTML
    b. clean & organized CSS styles
    c. DRY JavaScript
2. localStorage to persist data
3. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
4. Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX
